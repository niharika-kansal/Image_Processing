This repository contains an introductory notebook on Image Processing using Python. It demonstrates basic techniques for reading, visualizing, normalizing, and converting images with popular Python libraries.

📌 Features

Load and display images (color & grayscale)

Explore image properties (height, width, channels, size, data type)

Normalize pixel values to [0,1]

Convert grayscale → black & white (thresholding)

Convert grayscale → colored (using Matplotlib colormaps)

Work with built-in sample images from scikit-image


🛠️ Technologies Used

NumPy – numerical operations

Matplotlib – plotting & colormaps

scikit-image – image loading & sample datasets

PIL (Pillow) – image format conversion


📊 Example Outputs

Original Image

Grayscale Image

Black & White Thresholded Image

Colormap Applied Image
